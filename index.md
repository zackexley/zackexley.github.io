### HELLO!
Don't know what brought you here, but since you aksed, here's a little bit about me: I just finished a fellowship at [Harvard's Shorenstein Center](http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/newsplus/shorenstein-center-announces-spring-2017-fellows/) where among other things  [I wrote this paper](https://shorensteincenter.org/anatomy-of-alt-right-youtuber/). Last year, I served on the Bernie Sanders campaign where [I was honored to work alongside](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/features/2016-02-24/behind-bernie-sanders-revolution-lies-a-meticulously-engineered-grassroots-network) thousands of amazing grassroots leaders who made miracles happen. After the campaign, as a volunteer I helped start [Brand New Congress](http://brandnewcongress.org), an effort seeking to [replace pretty much the entire corrupt U.S. Congress](https://www.thenation.com/article/is-brand-new-congress-the-future-of-progressive-politics/) with a slate of honest and visionary local leaders, and [Justice Democrats](https://justicedemocrats.com/) which has been called a [Tea Party](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/01/23/progressives-launch-justice-democrats-to-counter-primary-corporate-legislators/) for the Democratic Party. In my day job, I work with some amazing campaigners, organizers and fundrasers at a firm called [Middle Seat](https://middleseat.co). We help organizations, campaigns and businesses fundraise, organize and make their users happier.

### Rules for Revolutionaries

My old friend and colleague from the Bernie campaign Becky Bond and I coauthored a book: [Rules for Revolutionaries: How Big Organizing Can Change Everything](https://www.amazon.com/Rules-Revolutionaries-Organizing-Change-Everything-ebook/dp/B01MG20YZ0). It's been making the rounds, and we've had a lot of fun speaking to groups about Big Organizing. Please get in touch if you'd like one or both of us to speak to your group.

### New project

While working on Brand New Congress, I saw a need for a new kind of think tank with a unique focus on big, comprehensive plans to tackle the world's biggest problems. I'm workign to start that now. It's called [Left Right Forward](https://leftrightforward.org), but it's really just embryonic now.

### YouTube Experiment 

Inspired by the Alt Right's total take over of YouTube–which more people watch now than all of TV (read my [paper](https://shorensteincenter.org/anatomy-of-alt-right-youtuber/))–I made some videos that attempted to engage an audience there on economic issues in a new way. Check out the videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVrE6_b8mFBXkodk6gO54rg). 

### Other stuff I think about
I spend as much time as I can reading history and economics. I'm focused on how poor countries become rich, and how countries with declining living standards like the U.S. can turn things around. The first book I recommend to everyone is Cambirdge Economist Ha-Joon Chang's [Bad Samaritans](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003Z9L4NA/).
