Since you asked, here's a little bit about me. At the moment I'm starting a new economic policy project called [New Consensus](http://newconsensus.com). We're working to equip a new generation of leaders with powerful ideas about how we humans can regain control over our means of making a living and make a better economic life for ourselves. We've been involved in launching, and shaping the ideas around, the [Green New Deal](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/12/21/18144138/green-new-deal-alexandria-ocasio-cortez). 

Before that, I co-founded [Justice Democrats](https://justicedemocrats.com/) and [Brand New Congress](http://brandnewcongress.org), campaigns to [replace every corrupt or complict member of the U.S. Congress](https://www.thenation.com/article/is-brand-new-congress-the-future-of-progressive-politics/) with a slate of honest and visionary local leaders. And they [made a beautiful movie](https://knockdownthehouse.com) about it! 

I served on the Bernie Sanders 2016 campaign, where [I was honored to work alongside](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/features/2016-02-24/behind-bernie-sanders-revolution-lies-a-meticulously-engineered-grassroots-network) thousands of amazing grassroots leaders who made many miracles happen.

A long long time ago, I did things like [organize the first flash mobs](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2000/12/organizing-online/) before anyone had a name for that, make the first political parodoy site on the Internet, which made [George W Bush to call me](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPcap/1999-11/29/002r-112999-idx.html) a "garbage man" and declare "there ought to be limits to freedom," and develop some of the first tools for online organizing. I was the first organizing director at MoveOn.org when we were trying to prevent the Iraq War, and then brought our techniques and tools into presidential politics with the Dean and Kerry campaigns.

I spent the 90's working as a union organizer across the midwest and south, working inside some of factories I organized, experiences that taught me most of whatever I know about politics. I counted once, and I've had more than 100 actual jobs since I started working at 14. 

I was recently a fellow at [Harvard's Shorenstein Center](http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/newsplus/shorenstein-center-announces-spring-2017-fellows/) where, among other things,  [I wrote this paper](https://shorensteincenter.org/anatomy-of-alt-right-youtuber/). 

I spend as much time as I can reading history and economics. I'm focused on how poor countries become rich, and how countries with declining living standards like the U.S. can turn things around – while saving the planet! The first book I recommend to everyone is Cambridge Economist Ha-Joon Chang's [Bad Samaritans](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003Z9L4NA/).

### Rules for Revolutionaries

Becky Bond and I wrote a book about organizing based on our experiences on the Bernie campaign called [Rules for Revolutionaries: How Big Organizing Can Change Everything](https://www.amazon.com/Rules-Revolutionaries-Organizing-Change-Everything-ebook/dp/B01MG20YZ0). Meeting and speaking to groups of fans of the book all over the world has been one of the most rewarding things I've ever had the chance to do.

### YouTube Experiment 

Last summer, inspired by the Alt Right's complete takeover of YouTube–which more people watch now than television (read my [paper](https://shorensteincenter.org/anatomy-of-alt-right-youtuber/)), I made some videos that attempted to engage an audience there on economic issues in a new way. Check out the videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVrE6_b8mFBXkodk6gO54rg). 

### Speaking

I really love to travel and speak to groups around the world -- especially if we can spend a bunch of time before and after brainstorming and learning from each other. Over the past few years, I've given talks about organizing, social change and economic policy around North America, Latin America, Europe, India, China and South Africa. But it really interferes with getting actual work done! Therefore, I now condense my speaking into a couple of two-week speaking sprints to cities where local groups want to organize a talk for me. I do these for no speaking fees, but only small optional donations from the hosting groups to cover travel costs. To look into bringing me to your city, email me at zack@newconsensus.com

If you're an org with the budget to pay speaking fees, I do make exceptions to my above rule, because speaking to like-minded groups of great people is definitely my favorite way to pay the bills.
