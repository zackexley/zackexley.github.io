## Building a prosperous future for all

I have always believed that humanity has everything it needs to build a sustainable economy that delivers prosperity for all<a href="#" title="I love the em dash and I'm not giving it up." style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit; border-bottom: 1px dotted #999;"> — </a>in one generation. Recent developments now make that more easily achievable than ever before. Helping that to happen is my primary focus.

I'm the Executive Director of [New Consensus](https://newconsensus.com), where we're building the **Mission for America** — a comprehensive plan for how America thrives in the age of AI. We're designing economic policy that ensures the massive productivity gains from artificial intelligence translate into broadly shared prosperity, not deeper inequality.

### The Mission for America

The Mission for America is a detailed playbook for national economic transformation. It addresses how the U.S. can harness AI and other transformative technologies to rebuild its industrial base, create millions of great jobs, and achieve environmental sustainability — all at the same time.

### Background

Before New Consensus, I co-founded [Justice Democrats](https://justicedemocrats.com/) and [Brand New Congress](http://brandnewcongress.org) — campaigns to replace every corrupt member of the U.S. Congress with honest, visionary local leaders. They [made a beautiful movie](https://knockdownthehouse.com) about us that you can watch on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCSo2hZRcXk) or Netflix.

I served on the 2016 Bernie Sanders campaign, where [I helped build](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/features/2016-02-24/behind-bernie-sanders-revolution-lies-a-meticulously-engineered-grassroots-network) the grassroots organizing infrastructure that powered the movement.

I was involved in creating the [Green New Deal](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/12/21/18144138/green-new-deal-alexandria-ocasio-cortez), which reframed climate policy as economic opportunity.

Becky Bond and I wrote [Rules for Revolutionaries: How Big Organizing Can Change Everything](https://www.amazon.com/Rules-Revolutionaries-Organizing-Change-Everything-ebook/dp/B01MG20YZ0) based on our experiences on the Bernie campaign.

#### A few of my greatest hits:

- Organized the [first flash mobs](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2000/12/organizing-online/) and first purely online-organized protests
- Created the first political parody website, which made [George W. Bush call me](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPcap/1999-11/29/002r-112999-idx.html) a "garbage man" and declare "there ought to be limits to freedom"
- Helped lead MoveOn.org as its first Organizing Director — the first major online political organization
- Built cutting-edge online organizing and fundraising tools for the Dean, Kerry, Obama, and Bernie presidential campaigns
- Worked as a union organizer all through my 20s, in factories all over the Midwest and South
- Watched the rise of Trump living in a tiny town in Missouri
- Served as Chief Community Officer for Wikipedia
- Saw real communism while studying in Xi'an, China for a year in 1987
- Lived in a tiny village in western Kenya before running water or electricity arrived
- Led the NGO and political practice at a global software services firm, serving organizations and parties in Brazil, South Africa, India, and the US
