## Building a prosperous future for all

I have always believed that humanity has everything it needs to build a sustainable economy that delivers prosperity for all — in one generation. Recent developments now make that more easily achievable than ever before. Helping that to happen is my primary focus.

I'm the Executive Director of [New Consensus](https://newconsensus.com), where we're building the **Mission for America** — a comprehensive plan for how America thrives in the age of AI. We're designing economic policy that ensures the massive productivity gains from artificial intelligence translate into broadly shared prosperity, not deeper inequality.

### The Mission for America

The Mission for America is a detailed playbook for national economic transformation. It addresses how the U.S. can harness AI and other transformative technologies to rebuild its industrial base, create millions of great jobs, and achieve environmental sustainability — all at the same time.

### Background

Before New Consensus, I co-founded [Justice Democrats](https://justicedemocrats.com/) and [Brand New Congress](http://brandnewcongress.org) — campaigns to replace every corrupt member of the U.S. Congress with honest, visionary local leaders. They [made a beautiful movie](https://knockdownthehouse.com) about us that you can watch on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCSo2hZRcXk) or Netflix.

I served on the 2016 Bernie Sanders campaign, where [I helped build](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/features/2016-02-24/behind-bernie-sanders-revolution-lies-a-meticulously-engineered-grassroots-network) the grassroots organizing infrastructure that powered the movement.

I was involved in creating the [Green New Deal](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/12/21/18144138/green-new-deal-alexandria-ocasio-cortez), which reframed climate policy as economic opportunity.

Before all that, I spent the 90s as a union organizer across the Midwest and South, working inside some of the factories I organized. I was the first organizing director at MoveOn.org, and helped pioneer online organizing and fundraising tools in presidential politics.

Becky Bond and I wrote [Rules for Revolutionaries: How Big Organizing Can Change Everything](https://www.amazon.com/Rules-Revolutionaries-Organizing-Change-Everything-ebook/dp/B01MG20YZ0) based on our experiences on the Bernie campaign.
