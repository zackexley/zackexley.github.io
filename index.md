Since you asked, here's a little of what I've been up to. Recently, I've been helping to found a new economic policy project called [New Consensus](http://newconsensus.com), intended to equip a new generation of leaders with powerful ideas about how Americans and all of humanity can regain control over our means of making a living and economic life. Most recently, we've been involved in shaping the ideas around the [Green New Deal](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/12/21/18144138/green-new-deal-alexandria-ocasio-cortez). 

Last year, I did a fellowship at [Harvard's Shorenstein Center](http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/newsplus/shorenstein-center-announces-spring-2017-fellows/) where, among other things,  [I wrote this paper](https://shorensteincenter.org/anatomy-of-alt-right-youtuber/). Before that, I served on the Bernie Sanders campaign where [I was honored to work alongside](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/features/2016-02-24/behind-bernie-sanders-revolution-lies-a-meticulously-engineered-grassroots-network) thousands of amazing grassroots leaders who made many miracles happen. Later, as a volunteer I helped start [Brand New Congress](http://brandnewcongress.org), a campaign to [replace pretty much the entire corrupt U.S. Congress](https://www.thenation.com/article/is-brand-new-congress-the-future-of-progressive-politics/) with a slate of honest and visionary local leaders, and [Justice Democrats](https://justicedemocrats.com/), which has been called a [Tea Party](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/01/23/progressives-launch-justice-democrats-to-counter-primary-corporate-legislators/) for the Democratic Party. 

### Rules for Revolutionaries

Becky Bond and I wrote a book about organizing based on our experiences on the Bernie campaign called [Rules for Revolutionaries: How Big Organizing Can Change Everything](https://www.amazon.com/Rules-Revolutionaries-Organizing-Change-Everything-ebook/dp/B01MG20YZ0). We've had a lot of fun speaking to groups all around the world about Big Organizing. Please get in touch if you'd like one or both of us to speak to your group.

### YouTube Experiment 

Last summer, inspired by the Alt Right's complete takeover of YouTube–which more people watch now than television (read my [paper](https://shorensteincenter.org/anatomy-of-alt-right-youtuber/))–I made some videos that attempted to engage an audience there on economic issues in a new way. Check out the videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVrE6_b8mFBXkodk6gO54rg). 

### Other stuff I think about
I spend as much time as I can reading history and economics. I'm focused on how poor countries become rich, and how countries with declining living standards like the U.S. can turn things around. The first book I recommend to everyone is Cambridge Economist Ha-Joon Chang's [Bad Samaritans](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003Z9L4NA/).
