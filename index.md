### HELLO!
You aksed, so here's a little bit about me...

I'm just trying to figure out how in the world we're going to get out of this mess. Right now I'm working with some amazing friends to do that as best we can. Check back for updates!

I live in a small town in rural Southwest Missouri where my wife grew up. I am from West Hartford, Connecticut, which is the opposite of rural Southwest Missouri. 

Here's what I've been up to. Last year, I did a fellowship at [Harvard's Shorenstein Center](http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/newsplus/shorenstein-center-announces-spring-2017-fellows/) where, among other things,  [I wrote this paper](https://shorensteincenter.org/anatomy-of-alt-right-youtuber/). Before that, I served on the Bernie Sanders campaign where [I was honored to work alongside](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/features/2016-02-24/behind-bernie-sanders-revolution-lies-a-meticulously-engineered-grassroots-network) thousands of amazing grassroots leaders who made many miracles happen. Later, as a volunteer I helped start [Brand New Congress](http://brandnewcongress.org), a campaign to [replace pretty much the entire corrupt U.S. Congress](https://www.thenation.com/article/is-brand-new-congress-the-future-of-progressive-politics/) with a slate of honest and visionary local leaders, and [Justice Democrats](https://justicedemocrats.com/), which has been called a [Tea Party](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/01/23/progressives-launch-justice-democrats-to-counter-primary-corporate-legislators/) for the Democratic Party. In my day job, I work with amazing campaigners, organizers and fundraisers at a firm called [Middle Seat](https://middleseat.co).

### Rules for Revolutionaries

Becky Bond and I wrote a book about organizing based on our experiences on the Bernie campaign called [Rules for Revolutionaries: How Big Organizing Can Change Everything](https://www.amazon.com/Rules-Revolutionaries-Organizing-Change-Everything-ebook/dp/B01MG20YZ0). We've had a lot of fun speaking to groups all around the world about Big Organizing. Please get in touch if you'd like one or both of us to speak to your group.

### YouTube Experiment 

Last summer, inspired by the Alt Right's complete takeover of YouTube–which more people watch now than television (read my [paper](https://shorensteincenter.org/anatomy-of-alt-right-youtuber/))–I made some videos that attempted to engage an audience there on economic issues in a new way. Check out the videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVrE6_b8mFBXkodk6gO54rg). 

### Other stuff I think about
I spend as much time as I can reading history and economics. I'm focused on how poor countries become rich, and how countries with declining living standards like the U.S. can turn things around. The first book I recommend to everyone is Cambridge Economist Ha-Joon Chang's [Bad Samaritans](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003Z9L4NA/).
